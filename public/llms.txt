## What is Ideate?

Ideate is a free, open-source AI-powered app design tool that generates beautiful mobile and desktop UI mockups from text descriptions. Unlike other AI design tools, Ideate uses a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model, meaning users provide their own API keys from OpenRouter or Google Gemini — making it completely free to use with no subscription fees.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Streaming Design Generation**: Watch your designs build token-by-token with live preview
- **Mobile and Desktop Support**: Generate mockups for both mobile apps (iPhone 390x844) and desktop applications
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Use your own OpenRouter or Google Gemini API keys — no vendor lock-in
- **Figma-like Canvas**: Zoom, pan, and navigate designs with intuitive controls using react-zoom-pan-pinch
- **Inline Editing**: Request changes to specific screens and watch them update in real-time
- **Visual Feedback**: Blue pulsing for screens being edited, green checkmarks for completed designs
- **Code Export**: Export clean HTML + Tailwind CSS code ready for production
- **Conversation History**: AI remembers context for iterative refinement
- **Project Management**: Organize designs with custom names and emoji icons
- **Image Reference Support**: Paste or upload style reference images for AI to match aesthetic
