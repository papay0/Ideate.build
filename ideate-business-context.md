## What Is Ideate?

**Ideate** (ideate.build) is an AI-powered prototyping tool that creates interactive mobile and desktop app prototypes in real-time. Users describe their app idea in plain English and get a working, clickable prototype in ~5 seconds.

**Tagline:** "Describe your app idea. Get a working prototype in seconds."

**Core Value Proposition:** Turn ideas into interactive prototypes 10-24x faster than competitors, with better design quality, without any design skills required.

|--------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Time to first prototype** | ~5 seconds | 2-3 minutes |
| **Output type** | Interactive clickable prototype | Static mockups or code |
| **Navigation** | Working screen-to-screen navigation | Manual setup required |
| **Design quality** | Polished, distinctive aesthetics | Generic component-based |
| **Iteration** | Conversational (chat to refine) | Regenerate from scratch |
| **Open source** | Yes (MIT license) | No |

## Key Messages for Outreach

### For Founders
"Stop spending weeks on prototypes. Describe your app, get a working demo in seconds. Show investors what you're building, not slides."

### For Product Managers
"Get stakeholder buy-in faster. Turn feature specs into interactive prototypes your team can actually click through."

### For Developers
"Skip the design phase. Plan your frontend with AI-generated prototypes, then build the real thing."

### For Agencies
"Wow clients in the first call. Show multiple prototype options before they've finished explaining."

## Objection Handling

**"I can use v0/Lovable"**
→ Those generate code, not prototypes. Ideate is 10x faster for testing ideas before you commit to building.

**"I have Figma"**
→ Figma requires design skills. Ideate lets anyone create professional prototypes with just words.

**"2 free messages isn't enough"**
→ BYOK is completely unlimited and free. Use your own API key and pay only for what you use.

**"Is it production-ready code?"**
→ No, and that's intentional. Ideate is for validating ideas fast, not generating production code. Test first, build right.

**"What about custom branding?"**
→ The AI generates unique designs each time. For consistent branding, describe your style in the prompt.
